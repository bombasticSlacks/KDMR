# KDM Randomizer

Randomizes battles to do in KDM

## Features

- Select a tier of characters and it will generate you survivors, gear and a monster/nemesis
- Sometimes generates unique survivors from different expansions (Saviors, twilight nights, constellation havers)
- Set which expansions you own in options
- Stuff to do around camp before departure

## Note

- Designed with the Community Edition in mind. Without it some items like the Beast Knuckle may seem incorrectly tiered. Others like the CE Kingsman Armour are relegated to the CE "Expansion".
- There is always a chance for an item to either be one tier higher or lower (10%), this can lead to exciting or odd inclusions in a hunt.
- Missing content like the Killenium Butcher and Indomitable survivors is because I don't own them. Content I own but haven't transcribed is in #Todo
- This will need some balancing, debating adding a hidden tier 5 that you can only roll up into for things like green armour.

## Tiers

- 1 Fighting basic monsters with some equipment
