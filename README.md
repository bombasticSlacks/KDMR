# Nomads

Survivors sit around a fire in the plain of faces, the camp site is well organized and reeks of vile burning rubber. They either hunt or are hunted.

For 1-6 players, Nomad allows you to randomize a hunt against a monster. Survivors will have pre-generated stats, abilities, a list of gear to distribute amongst yourself. Perfect for small 1 off sessions of the best boss battler around.

Tries to recreate the experience of endeavouring, designing effective loadouts, hunting, and the showdown with a streamlined camp phase, and full hunt and showdown phases.

Full expansion is available and hosted at https://kdmr.bombasticgames.com/ as a lightweight website, no printing required.

## Features

- Select a tier of characters and it will generate you survivors, gear, and a monster/nemesis
- Sometimes generates unique survivors from different expansions (Saviors, twilight nights, constellation havers)
- Set which expansions you own in options
- Stuff to do around camp before departure

## Note

- Designed with the Community Edition in mind. Without it some items like the Beast Knuckle may seem incorrectly tiered. Others like the CE Kingsman Armour are relegated to the CE "Expansion".
- There is always a chance for an item to either be one tier higher or lower (10%), this can lead to exciting or odd inclusions in a hunt.
- Missing content like the Killenium Butcher and Indomitable survivors is because I don't own them. Content I own but haven't transcribed is in #Todo
- This will need some balancing, debating adding a hidden tier 5 that you can only roll up into for things like green armour.

## Tiers

- 0 Starting out
- 1 Fighting basic monsters with some equipment
- 2 Have heat
