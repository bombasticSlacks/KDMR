        <li>Custom Scout gear grids <a
                href="./data/Scout.png"">here</a>, however the default grid may also be used. Original idea for 6 player rules from <a href="

        <li>You can gain Resources, they follow standard rules during hunt and showdown phase.</li>

                allies
                as well as any fire starters they carried.

            <p class="flavour">The remaining survivors stand over their kill. They gather the pieces and begin the
                process of harvest and allocation. Once the survivors are satisfied they begin to separate; some quickly
                vanish into the dark worried to be followed, others discuss their heading deciding to move together. In
                the darkness of the plain of faces the dim lights of similar fires can be seen.</p>

            <h3>ðŸ•® Avenger In The Dark</h3>
            <p class="flavour">In the darkness 4 nomads lay dead, barely illuminated by lantern light, a monster
                lingers picking at them until something silent moves to attack. In the darkness of the plain of
                faces many lay dead, reeking of rubber and fire.</p>
